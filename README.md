# NeuralEstimators

This repository contains the source code for the `R` interface to the `Julia` package `NeuralEstimators`, which facilitates the development of neural estimators in a user-friendly manner. The native `Julia` version is available [here](https://github.com/msainsburydale/NeuralEstimators.jl). 

## Installation tips

To install `NeuralEstimators`, please: 

1. Install `Julia` (see [here](https://julialang.org/)) and `R` (see [here](https://www.r-project.org/)).
2. Install the `Julia` version of `NeuralEstimators` from [here](https://github.com/msainsburydale/NeuralEstimators.jl). 
3. Install the `R` interface to `NeuralEstimators` using the `R` command `devtools::install_github("msainsburydale/NeuralEstimators")`.

## Getting started

See the package vignette for an overview of the framework and package, and for an illustrative example.
